Using DFS:
// We maintain a dfsvis vector this time alongwith vis.
// As we traverse in dfs order we keep on marking vis and dfsvis as 1.
// If we have traversed a paricular node and we go back to the parent function, then we mark dfsvis of this node as 0.
  
Algorithm: 
// Create the graph using the given number of edges and vertices.
// Create a recursive function that initializes the current index or vertex, visited, and recursion stack.
// Mark the current node as visited and also mark the index in recursion stack.
// Find all the vertices which are not visited and are adjacent to the current node. 
// Recursively call the function for those vertices, If the recursive function returns true, return true.
// If the adjacent vertices are already marked in the recursion stack then return true.
// Create a wrapper class, that calls the recursive function for all the vertices and if any function returns true return true. 
// Else if for all vertices the function returns false return false.

Using BFS: Kahns Algorithm
// A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
// Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length.
// Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, 
// if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path
// => indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

// Algorithm: Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:
// Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

// Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

// Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
    // Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
    // Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
    // If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
// Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.
// Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.
